# TKTrakker

## Story

A long time ago in a distant Tarkov land, a group of friends of mine, and I needed a way to track the team kills plaguing our Discord server (per wipe) and have a way to shame people for their incessant ineptitude. 

TKTrakker was born.  

This is version 0, "The Timmy".  I have a little more way to go.  

The intent here is to have admins interact with the bot, and be able to increment, decrement, reset and print the current TK stats.  

Thats the mission.
